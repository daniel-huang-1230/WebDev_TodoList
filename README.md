# WebDev_TodoList
Simple to-do list built with jQuery


# Project Overview

The web app utilizes **jquery-3.2.1.** to build a to-do list.  The goal is to learn how to incoporate **jQuery** properly and 
ge some practice in more advanced **CSS** such as **animation**, **box-shadow**, etc.
The features include adding/deleting entries, and crossing out 
the entries that are completed. The icons are from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) and the gradient background color 
is done through **CSS** with the code from the website [uiGradients](http://uigradients.com/?ref=boomkrak.com#Instagram). 

The below GIF shows the basic workflow of the application:
